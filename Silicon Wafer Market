➣ By Wafer Size:
300mm Wafers dominate the market, accounting for an estimated 45-50% market share. These wafers are the industry standard for advanced semiconductor manufacturing, particularly in the production of high-performance integrated circuits used in consumer electronics and automotive applications. The large size of 300mm wafers allows for higher yields and more efficient production processes, making them the preferred choice for most large-scale semiconductor manufacturers.
200mm Wafers hold about 30-35% of the market. While not as advanced as 300mm wafers, 200mm wafers are still widely used, especially in the production of mature technology nodes and in industries where cutting-edge technology is not as critical, such as certain segments of the industrial and automotive markets.
150mm and Below wafers, which include 150mm, 125mm, and smaller sizes, make up approximately 15-20% of the market. These smaller wafers are generally used for niche applications and legacy equipment. They are particularly prevalent in older semiconductor fabs and in the production of specialty devices where large wafers are not necessary.
450mm Wafers, though still emerging, represent less than 1% of the market. These larger wafers are seen as the next frontier in semiconductor manufacturing, promising significant improvements in efficiency and cost per chip. However, their adoption has been slow due to the high capital costs required to develop and retool fabs for 450mm production.
